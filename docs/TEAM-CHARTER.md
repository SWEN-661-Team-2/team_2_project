## 2. Purpose & Goals

The purpose of this team is to design and evaluate user interface solutions that support left-handed caregivers in performing digital workflows efficiently and comfortably. The team aims to address a usability gap in existing digital tools, which overwhelmingly assume right-handed interaction patterns, resulting in increased friction for left-handed users.

### Goals

The team’s goals for this project are to:

1. Design an inclusive interface that accommodates left-handed ergonomics without degrading right-handed usability.
2. Improve workflow efficiency for left-handed caregivers in common tasks such as documentation, scheduling, and communication.
3. Apply human-centered design practices including research, prototyping, and usability testing.
4. Deliver a functional prototype and supporting documentation suitable for academic evaluation.
5. Demonstrate academic understanding of usability, interaction design, accessibility, and inclusive technology design.

### Desired Outcomes

By the end of the project, the team aims to produce:

- A prototype interface optimized for left-handed interaction  
- Research artifacts informing design decisions  
- Usability findings based on testing and evaluation  

---

## 3. Scope

The scope of this project will be to create a user design and interface of the application for left-handed users. This will not include the setup or implementation of servers and backend programming. This will be strictly the presentation of data within the application.

### In Scope (what the team will do)

- Design user interface concepts for left-handed caregiver workflows  
- Create wireframes, prototypes, and visual design components  
- Conduct research related to left-handed usability and ergonomics  
- Perform usability testing and gather feedback  
- Document design decisions, research findings, and user testing outcomes  
- Produce a front-end or prototype-level implementation sufficient for demonstration  

### Out of Scope (what the team will not do)

- Backend system development (servers, databases, APIs, authentication, etc.)  
- Full production deployment or platform distribution  
- Integration with real clinical systems or medical devices  
- Handling of live patient data or compliance with HIPAA/PHI regulations  
- Non-UI features unrelated to handedness, ergonomics, or caregiver workflows

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

### Assigned Roles

**1. Project Lead / Coordinator**  
Responsibilities:  
- Schedules meetings and ensures timely communication  
- Tracks deadlines, deliverables, and milestone progress  
- Removes blockers and coordinates task handoffs  

**2. UX Design Lead**  
Responsibilities:  
- Produces wireframes, user flows, and prototypes  
- Leads visual design and layout decisions  
- Applies handedness-inclusive interaction patterns  

**3. Research & Usability Lead**  
Responsibilities:  
- Conducts literature review and requirement gathering  
- Develops personas and journey maps  
- Plans and executes usability testing and documents findings  

### Shared Responsibilities (All Members)

All team members will:  
- Contribute to documentation and final report  
- Participate in testing and evaluation  
- Conduct research activities as needed  
- Contribute to design activities and feedback cycles  
- Review and approve major team decisions  

---

## 5. Decision-Making Rules

### Decision Process

1. The team will begin with a discussion of the issue, including clarification of the problem and relevant context.  
2. Pros and cons will be identified as needed.  
3. After discussion, a decision will be made by vote.  

### Voting Method

- Decisions require a simple majority (**2 out of 3**) to pass.

### Tie-Break Rule

- Project Lead initiates a brief follow-up discussion.  
- If still unresolved, Project Lead makes the final decision.  

### Decision Types

- **Minor decisions** (e.g., formatting) may be made informally.  
- **Major decisions** (e.g., scope changes, final design directions) follow voting rules.  

### Timeboxing Discussions

- Major decisions are timeboxed (10–15 minutes) to avoid delays.

## 6. Ways of Working

### Communication Channels

- **Primary:** Microsoft Teams  
- **Secondary:** University Email  
- **Backup:** Personal Email or phone (urgent only)  

### Response Expectations

- Messages (Mon–Fri) responded to within 24 hours.  
- Notify group if reduced availability is expected.  

### Meeting Cadence

- Weekly synchronous meeting (15–30 minutes)  
- Additional ad-hoc meetings as needed  

### Tools & Collaboration Platforms

- **Communication:** Microsoft Teams, University Email  
- **Documentation:** UMGC Group Locker (shared files, revision history)  
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub  
- **Development Tools:** VS Code or equivalent IDEs  

### File & Versioning Management

- Code managed through Git/GitHub branch and commit history  
- Shared docs use Group Locker versioning  
- Final documentation reviewed for consistency  

### Deadlines & Task Management

- Deadlines follow course syllabus and project timeline  
- Tasks assigned with clear owners and due dates  
- Team members anticipating delays notify others early

## 7. Values & Behavior Standards

### Respect

- Treat all team members professionally and courteously  
- Listen actively to differing perspectives

## 8. Conflict Resolution Approach

Conflicts are handled through structured communication:

1. **Direct Discussion** — Issue discussed calmly and factually  
2. **Evaluation & Solutions** — Options and pros/cons identified  
3. **Decision via Voting** — Simple majority  
4. **Mediation (If Needed)** — Neutral member mediates; if Lead involved, another member mediates  
5. **Escalation (Last Resort)** — Escalate to instructor if unresolved
