## Running on Mobile Devices (Team Convention)

CareConnect is developed **mobile-first**.

### Primary development targets
- Android Emulator (API 36)
- iOS Simulator (iPhone 15 Pro Max)

Chrome/Web is used only for quick layout sanity checks and should not be treated
as a primary development target.

### Run both mobile platforms simultaneously

From the Flutter app directory:

```bash
./scripts/run_mobile.sh
