# Handedness + Accessibility (CareConnect-LH)

## Handedness Modes
- Left-Handed View: UI content is biased for left-hand reach (padding + placement rules).
- Right-Handed View: UI content is biased for right-hand reach.
- Toggle Mode: shows an on-screen toggle affordance (for quick switching during evaluation).

## Accessibility Overlay (Debug)
A toggleable overlay is provided to support design review and documentation. When enabled, it displays an always-visible indicator that the overlay is active and can be extended to include tap-target annotations and semantics hints.
